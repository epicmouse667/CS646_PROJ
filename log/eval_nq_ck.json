Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Anna Le Moine and Anna Le Moine and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Anna Le Moine and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco . During the restoration work , which ended in 1995 , the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue . All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system .",
